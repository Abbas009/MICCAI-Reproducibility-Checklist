# MICCAI-Reproducibility-Checklist
Submission for MICCAI HACKATHON: https://miccai-hackathon.com/#participate

## REPRODUCIBILITY 1: WHAT DOES IT NEED FOR A MICCAI PAPER TO BE REPRODUCIBLE?
- Create a machine learning reproducibility checklist specific to MICCAI papers.
- Propose a machine learning code completeness checklist specific to MICCAI papers.
- How to ensure reproducibility when the data cannot be shared?

## Reproducibility checklist for machine learning-based MICCAI papers

The checklist builds on the [machine learning reproducibility checklist](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf), but is specific to MICCAI papers.
We also got lots of insights from

- Mongan, John, Linda Moy, and Charles E. Kahn Jr. "Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM): A guide for authors and reviewers." Radiology: Artificial Intelligence (2020): e200029.
- Norgeot, Beau, Giorgio Quer, Brett K. Beaulieu-Jones, Ali Torkamani, Raquel Dias, Milena Gianfrancesco, Rima Arnaout et al. "Minimum information about clinical artificial intelligence modeling: the MI-CLAIM checklist." Nature Medicine 26, no. 9 (2020): 1320-1324

    - average and standard divation of evaluation metrics
    - statistical analysis

- Qualititative analysis
    - box/violin plot, ROC curves
    - visualized examples of both successful and **failed** cases


## Code checklist for machine learning-based MICCAI papers
>ðŸ“‹  A template README.md for code accompanying a Machine Learning-based MICCAI paper, which is built on [paperswithcode/releasing-research-code](https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code).
>
>Dataset, preprocessing, posting processing sections are added because these parts are very important to reproduce the results in medical image analysis community.

# My Paper Title

This repository is the official implementation of [My Paper Title](TBA). 

>ðŸ“‹  Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials



## Environments and Requirements

- Windows/Ubuntu version
- CPU, RAM, GPU information
- CUDA version
- python version

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...



## Dataset

- A link to download the data (if publicly available)
- A description about how to prepare the data (e.g., folder structures)

## Preprocessing

A brief description of preprocessing method

- cropping
- intensity normalization
- resampling

Running the data preprocessing code:

```python
python preprocessing.py --input_path <path_to_input_data> --output_path <path_to_output_data>
```

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.



## Trained Models

You can download trained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on the above dataset with the above code. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the trained models can be downloaded.



## Inference

To infer the testing cases, run this command:

```python
python inference.py --input-data <path_to_data> --model_path <path_to_trained_model> --output_path <path_to_output_data>
```

> ðŸ“‹  Describe how to infer on testing cases with the trained models.



## Evaluation

To compute the evaluation metrics, run:

```eval
python eval.py --seg_data <path_to_inference_results> --gt_data <path_to_ground_truth>
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the inference results and obtain the reported results in the paper.



## Results

Our method achieves the following performance on :

### [Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/)

| Model name       |  DICE  | 95% Hausdorff Distance |
| ---------------- | :----: | :--------------------: |
| My awesome model | 90.68% |         32.71          |

## How to ensure reproducibility when the data cannot be shared?

- Try to find a related public dataset to evaluate your method, e.g., [The Cancer Imaging Archive](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/), [grand-challenge](https://grand-challenge.org/challenges/).

- Create a docker container to pack the proposed method. Many MICCAI challenge have used the docker as the submission, e.g., [ADAM](http://adam.isi.uu.nl/methods/submit/), [M&Ms](https://www.ub.edu/mnms/)
